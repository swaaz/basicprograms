Getting Ready for Physics Class
You are a physics teacher preparing for the upcoming semester. You want to provide your students with some functions that will help them calculate some fundamental physical properties.

If you get stuck during this project or would like to see an experienced developer work through it, click “Get Help“ to see a project walkthrough video.

Turn up the Temperature
1.
Write a function called f_to_c that takes an input f_temp, a temperature in Fahrenheit, and converts it to c_temp, that temperature in Celsius.

It should then return c_temp.

The equation you should use is:

Temp (C) = (Temp (F) - 32) * 5/9
2.
Let’s test your function with a value of 100 Fahrenheit.

Define a variable f100_in_celsius and set it equal to the value of f_to_c with 100 as an input.

3.
Write a function called c_to_f that takes an input c_temp, a temperature in Celsius, and converts it to f_temp, that temperature in Fahrenheit.

It should then return f_temp.

The equation you should use is:

Temp (F) = Temp (C) * (9/5) + 32
4.
Let’s test your function with a value of 0 Celsius.

Define a variable c0_in_fahrenheit and set it equal to the value of c_to_f with 0 as an input.

Use the Force
5.
Define a function called get_force that takes in mass and acceleration. It should return mass multiplied by acceleration.

6.
Test get_force by calling it with the variables train_mass and train_acceleration.

Save the result to a variable called train_force and print it out.

7.
Print the string “The GE train supplies X Newtons of force.”, with X replaced by train_force.

8.
Define a function called get_energy that takes in mass and c.

c is a constant that is usually set to the speed of light, which is roughly 3 x 10^8. Set c to have a default value of 3*10**8.

get_energy should return mass multiplied by c squared.

9.
Test get_energy by using it on bomb_mass, with the default value of c. Save the result to a variable called bomb_energy.

10.
Print the string “A 1kg bomb supplies X Joules.”, with X replaced by bomb_energy.

Do the Work
11.
Define a final function called get_work that takes in mass, acceleration, and distance.

Work is defined as force multiplied by distance. First, get the force using get_force, then multiply that by distance. Return the result.

12.
Test get_work by using it on train_mass, train_acceleration, and train_distance. Save the result to a variable called train_work.

13.
Print the string "The GE train does X Joules of work over Y meters.", with X replaced with train_work and Y replaced with train_distance.
