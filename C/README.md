| Program-31 | Program to take the details of student and print the details of students using array and to add details of new students into the existing array |
| Program-32 | Program to take the details of student and print the details |
| Program-33 | Program on Arithematic operation using pointers  |
| Program-34 | Program to determine whether the matrix is a triangular matrix. First, you will be given N, which is the size of the matrix. Then you will be given N rows of integers, where each row consists of N integers separated by spaces. If the input matrix is triangular, then print yes. Otherwise, print no. |
| Program-35 | Program where you are given a sequence of non-negative integers terminated by -1. You have to output 1 if there are atleast 2 distinct elements in the sequence and 0 if the sequence consists of only 1 integer. Note that -1 is not part of the sequence. The sequence is not necessarily sorted. |
