Q. Java Program for simple interest

Simple interest formula is given by:
Simple Interest = (P x T x R)/100
Where,
P is the principle amount
T is the time and
R is the rate


EXAMPLE1:
Input : P = 10000
        R = 5
        T = 5
Output :2500
We need to find simple interest on 
Rs. 10, 000 at the rate of 5% for 5 
units of time.

EXAMPLE2:
Input : P = 3000
        R = 7
        T = 1
Output :210
